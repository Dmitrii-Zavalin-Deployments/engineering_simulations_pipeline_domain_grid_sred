# Declarative Validation Profile for Domain Metadata
# --------------------------------------------------
# These rules enforce logical consistency between bounding box and grid resolution fields.
# Each rule consists of:
#   - `if`: logical expression using dot notation for metadata keys
#   - `raise`: message triggered if condition evaluates to True

rules:
  - if: domain_definition.max_z <= domain_definition.min_z
    raise: "Invalid bounds: max_z must exceed min_z"

  - if: domain_definition.nx == 0
    raise: "Grid resolution nx must be nonzero"

  - if: domain_definition.max_x < domain_definition.min_x
    raise: "max_x cannot be less than min_x"
